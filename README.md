## ðŸ”¹About Nova

<table>
<tr>
<td>

**Nova**, a website that aims to helping interviewers to practice on interviews with the best and most skilled interviewers. Where the interviewer determines the specialization and languages he wants to train in, and then the site suggests to him the appropriate times with the available interviewers.

On the other hand, it helps interviewees to practice how interviews work and how to evaluate interviewees and communicate with them.
